## What small problems to solve?  How to solve?

Need to figure out how to get trigram frequencies from both test and training data.

- Need a function to read input files
- Need a function to read store trigram data of files into a map or arrays
- Need way to test out if trigram data is being stored correctly (printing?)

Need to verify files follow specifications. (a-z lowercase and ' 's only)

## Classes? Subclasses?


## What files will we need?


## Milestone 1 main?



## Milestone 2 main?


## Libraries?


## Files that compile script will need?
